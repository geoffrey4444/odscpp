# odscpp
My solutions to exercises in Open Data Structures in C++ (https://opendatastructures.org/ods-cpp.pdf).

I'm making this repo to play along as I read parts of Open Data Structures in C++. I plan to only attempt a (likely very small) subset of the problems. I'm doing this to learn, so my solutions might have any number of issues.
